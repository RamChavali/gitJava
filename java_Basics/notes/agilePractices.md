##Notes for Hangman Project:

###Agile Software Development Practices:
- **Agile Methodology** is a set of practices to use when programming that help you maintain focus and stay organized.
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- **User Stories**

###Program Overview:
1. Person A, the Prompter, comes up with a word.
2. Person B, the Guesser, will try to guess a letter at a time.
3. Guesser is shown blank spaces for unguessed letters.
4. Prompter keeps track of incorrect guess count.
5. There is a fixed number of incorrect guesses that can be made.
6. If Guesser guesses all guesses within fixed number allowed, they win.
7. If not, they lose.

###MVP - Minimim Viable Product:
- Some teams star by defining the **Minimum Viable Product**.
- Defining the MVP helps to define minimum requirements to prove that our product is working as we hypothesized it would.
- Which helps us keep our scope to only the required tasks, and nothing more.

###MVP - Our Project:
- We might be tempted to add a scoring system, or to ask the Guesser's name.
- BUt that doesn't realy help us get the software out the door any quicker.
- This is sort of along the same lines of the YAGNI - 'You Ain't Gonna Need It'.
- The idea is to get the prouct out as soon as possible.
- Then change it based on how users are actually using your software.
- Or even better, what is actually being directly requested from them.


###Building the Scope:
- A common way of building a scope is to build a prioritized backlog of user stories
- **User Stories** are another Agile Practice.
- Basically, they are development requests that are written in a certain form.
- Writing a good user story IS a skill and definitely an art form.
- But the main idea is to communicate on a high level that everyone can understand (both the people requesting the product and the people developing it).
- It shows WHAT will be delivered, and for WHAT reason.
- It does not expose the HOW - that is our job as the developers to figure it out.

###User Stories - Form:
- As a persona, I should be able to feature request, so that reason makes sense.
- The amount of user stories you choose is sometimes based on the estimate of effort that you agree upon with your team.
- In most Agile practices, the word **sprint** is used to define a set period of time, during whih specific work will be completed and made ready for review.
- The ToDo column in Trello example will represent our **spread?sprint?**.


###User Stories - Our Project:
1. As a guesser, I should be able to submit a guess so that I can play the game.
2. As a guesser, I should be presented with my current progress, so that I can make an educated guess.
3. As a guesser, I should know how many remaining tries I have left, so I am encouraged to be cautious.
4. A a guesser, I should be stoped from making a guess that has already been made, so that I do not waste turns.
5. As a guesser, I should be able to know when the game is solved or failed, so that I can acknowledge completion with celebration or tears.
6. Backlogged - As a prompter, I should know the guesser's name so that things can appear more friendly.
7. Backlogged - As a prompter, I should know the highest score, so that it can be used to encourage competition.


###Etc Takeaways:
- Trello - primarily used for keeping track of things, and is an awesome way of keeping track of doing software development through user stories. Has To Do, Doing, and Done columns feature.
